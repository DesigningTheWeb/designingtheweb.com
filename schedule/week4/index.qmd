## Visual Hierarchy: Practical Tips
::: incremental
- Keep key elements larger or bolder.
- Use whitespace to help users focus.
- Group related items together using proximity.
- Prioritize content based on importance and context.
- More details at [Web Style Guide: Chapter 2](https://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/2-universal-usability/index.html).

## Color Theory
::: incremental
- Basics of color relationships and contrast.
- Accessibility considerations (e.g., color-blind palettes).
- Use high contrast for readability and usability.
- Create color schemes with complementary and analogous colors.
- Use color meaning to evoke emotion or direct attention.

## Typography Fundamentals
::: incremental
- Font selection, spacing, and line height.
- Readability across devices.
- Use clear and legible fonts for better accessibility.
- Adjust line height and spacing for comfortable reading.
- Avoid using too many font types to ensure consistency.
- Opt for responsive typography that scales well on different screen sizes.

## CRAP Principles
::: incremental
- **Contrast**: Differentiate elements for clarity.
- **Repetition**: Maintain consistency in design.
- **Alignment**: Position elements deliberately.
- **Proximity**: Group related items together.

## Balancing Aesthetics and Usability
::: incremental
- Combine visual hierarchy, color theory, and typography.
- Keep CRAP principles in mind to maintain clarity.
- Ensure accessibility is not overlooked for aesthetic choices.

## Website Review

Critique a website based on the three principles:

- **Visual Hierarchy:** Does the layout make the most important information stand out? How are headings, subheadings, and calls to action organized?
- **Color Use:** Does the color scheme enhance or hinder readability? Does the design convey the intended message or mood?
- **Typography:** How readable is the text? Are headings and body text appropriately styled and sized?
- **CRAP:** How are the fundamental design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) used or not used?
